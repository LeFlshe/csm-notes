$f'(x)=\lim\limits_{h \to 0}\frac{(f(x+h)-f(x))}{h}$
obligatory writeout of point slope form $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$

$\frac{3}{5}$ is answer for the reflection

$f'(x) =10$
$2x+2=10$
$x=4$
If we were looking for horizontal...
then slope

$f'(x) = 0$
$2x+2=10$
$x=-1$

Differentiable if it's "locally linear," that meaning you can draw a non-vertical tangent line

If there's a sharp corner, there's two possible tangnet lines, no good

Editor's note: when I've been doing this, it's things (like $x^\frac{2}{3}$ at zero, for example) that are defined as sharp, i.e: when there's a bounce due to an absolute value or even power. If you can draw multiple tangent lines, you're not tangenting at that point

Vertical tangent line means that it's undefined

if it's non-continuous, we have nowhere to put a tangent line. 

If you're differentiable, than you're for sure continuous - but if you're continuous, you're not necessarily differentiable
